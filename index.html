        Vaishnavi, the two days we spent together in Mood Indigo were truly unforgettable. Itâ€™s amazing how quickly time flew by, and I still canâ€™t believe itâ€™s over. Youâ€™re such an incredible person, and from day one to the second day, we shared so many beautiful moments that Iâ€™ll cherish forever.
        <br><br>
        The Armaan Malik show was a highlight for me, especially that brief moment when we held hands for those two minutes. My heart was racing, and words fail to capture what I felt at that time. Your smile, your presence â€“ it all felt like a story Iâ€™d want to relive again and again.
        <br><br>
        These are some of the best memories Iâ€™ve made, and I hope they were special for you too, even if youâ€™ve had even better ones in your life. I sincerely hope we get another chance to create more moments like these in the future.
        <br><br>
        I know Iâ€™m not the most talkative person, but somehow, your warmth and energy balanced everything out perfectly. Thank you for making these days so memorable for me â€“ Iâ€™ll always hold them close to my heart.
